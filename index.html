I watched as we shared laughs, late-night secrets, and small dreams. Every conversation was like a drop of water, helping that seed grow. You weren't just a friend; you were the potential for everything I ever wanted. I remember looking at you and thinking, 'This is it. This is the person who will change my world forever.' And oh, how you did."
